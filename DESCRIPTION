Description: The package links data on violent events from the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) Georeferenced Event Dataset
	(GED) to armed conflicts listed in the UCDP Armed Conflict Dataset (ACD). Two functions first turn the UCDP ACD into a
	conflict-month dataset, and conduct some common data wrangling on the UCDP GED. The latter includes splitting multi-month
	events into separate months, with casualties divided between them. It also includes splitting casualties from violence
	perpetrated by coalition actors evenly between the actors. Casualties from violent events in UCDP GED are then linked 
	(aggregated to the month) to conflicts via actor identifiers where possible, and via the event location otherwise. This 
	includes all forms of violence coded in UCDP GED, including state-based violence (battles), one-sided violence against
	civilians, and non-state violence (communal violence, inter-rebel fighting). The end result is a conflict-month dataset with
	information on battle and war-related violence, as described in the article: Bara, Corinne & Maurice P. Schumann, "Who, what, 
	and where? Linking violence to civil wars", Research & Politics (2025).
